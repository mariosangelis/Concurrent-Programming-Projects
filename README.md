# ECE321 Concurrent Programming Team Projects

#### Project1:
>  Implementation of a digital baseband telecommunication system using m-PSK modulation (BPSK/QPSK/8-PSK/16-PSK) over an AWGN channel.

#### Project2:
>  Implementation of a digital baseband telecommunication system with a Flat fading LTI channel and Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC). 

#### Project3
>  Implementation of a digital baseband telecommunication system with a Flat fading LTI channel, Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) and MIMO with least squares channel inversion (LS) using MPSK and MQAM modulation techniques. 

#### Project4
>  Implementation of a digital baseband telecommunication system using OFDM transmission.
